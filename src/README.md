# Swipe App (React Native)
This is a swipe app just to practice building a react native app using Expo and create-react-native-app instead of react-native-cli.

Main purpose is to set up the most productive & stable environment for react native development on my pc.

## Local Environment
I am using my Windows 10 pc at the moment.  I will also test with my old MAC later to see if it runs smoothly.

## How to start the app
1. Use Expo XDE!
  Don't run the code directly from your terminal.
```
In the XDE in your computer, create a new project, and wait for it to run.
```
2. Install Expo app in your android device.
  I have not yet tested this with iOS device.

3. In Expo XDE, click "share" to display QR code.
4. Use the Expo app on your android device to scan the QR code.
Now the app should start on your device.
* Use your android device not the Android emulator to avoid complication and computer slowdown.
